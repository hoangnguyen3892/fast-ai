Dropout refers to a layer that randomly deletes (i.e. sets to zero) each activation in the previous layer with probability p (generally 0.5). This only happens during training, not when calculating the accuracy on the validation set, which is why the validation set can show higher accuracy than the training set."

By deleting parts of the neural network at random during training, it ensures that no one part of the network can overfit to one part of the training set. The creation of dropout was one of the key developments in deep learning, and has allowed us to create rich models without overfitting. However, it can also result in underfitting if overused, and this is something we should be careful of with our model."
